# README

This is just a repository of KiCad schematic library files developed at XESS.

* `Cypress_PSoC.lib` contains a few Cypress PSoC 5LP chips.
* `xilinx7.lib` contains **all** the Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs (Zynq, Artix, Kintex and Virtex).
* `xess.lib` contains a grab-bag of parts, many auto-converted over from Eagle.
